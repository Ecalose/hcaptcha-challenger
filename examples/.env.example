# CRUMB_COUNT: The number of challenge rounds you need to solve once the challenge starts.
# In the vast majority of cases this value will be 2, some specialized sites will set this value to 3.
# In most cases you don't need to change this value, the `_review_challenge_type` task determines the
# exact value of `CRUMB_COUNT` based on the information of the assigned task.
# Only manually change this value if you are working on a very specific task that prevents the
# `_review_challenge_type` from hijacking the task information and the maximum number of tasks > 2.
